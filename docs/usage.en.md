## Test Structure

A YATL test file is a YAML document with the following top-level keys:

- `name` (optional): Descriptive name of the test suite.
- `base_url` (optional): Base URL for all requests in the test.
- `skip` (optional): If set to `true`, the entire test will be skipped during execution.
- `steps`: List of test steps, each representing an HTTP request and its assertions.

Each step can contain the following fields:
- `name` (optional): step name for identification in logs
- `description` (optional): detailed description of the step's purpose
- `skip` (optional): if `true`, the step will be skipped
- `request` (required): HTTP request specification
- `expect` (optional): response assertions

Example:

```yaml
name: User API Test
base_url: http://localhost:8000

steps:
  - name: Create a user
    description: Create a new user in the system with the provided data
    request:
      method: POST
      url: /users
      body:
        json:
          id: 1
          name: John Doe
          email: john@example.com
    expect:
      status: 200
```

You can skip a test entirely by setting `skip: true` at the top level. This is useful for temporarily disabling a test without deleting it.

Example:

```yaml
name: Skipped Test
base_url: http://localhost:8000
skip: true

steps:
  - name: This step will not be executed
    request:
      method: GET
      url: /ping
```

Individual steps can also be skipped by adding `skip: true` inside the step. Such a step will be ignored and the context will not be updated.

Example:

```yaml
steps:
  - name: Active step
    request:
      method: GET
      url: /api/health
  - name: Skipped step
    skip: true
    request:
      method: POST
      url: /api/data
  - name: Next step
    request:
      method: GET
      url: /api/status
```

## HTTP Request Specification

Each step contains a `request` object with the following fields:

- `method` (required): HTTP method (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc.). Defaults to GET.
- `url` (required): Endpoint path, relative to `base_url`.
- `headers` (optional): Dictionary of HTTP headers.
- `params` (optional): Query parameters as key-value pairs.
- `cookies` (optional): Cookies as key-value pairs.
- `body` (optional): Request body, which can be JSON, XML, plain text, or form data.

### Body Types

YATL supports multiple body formats:

#### JSON

```yaml
body:
  json:
    key: value
    nested:
      field: 123
```

The `Content-Type` header will automatically be set to `application/json` if not provided.

#### XML

```yaml
body:
  xml: |
    <note>
      <to>User</to>
      <from>YATL</from>
    </note>
```

`Content-Type` will be set to `application/xml`.

#### Plain Text

```yaml
body:
  text: "Hello, world!"
```

`Content-Type` will be set to `text/plain`.

#### Form Data

```yaml
body:
  form:
    username: john
    password: secret
```

`Content-Type` will be set to `application/x-www-form-urlencoded`.

#### Multipart Files

```yaml
body:
  files:
    file: /path/to/file.txt
```

### Timeout

You can specify a request timeout (in seconds):

```yaml
request:
  timeout: 30
```

## Response Validation

After sending a request, you can validate the response using the `expect` block.

### Status Code

```yaml
expect:
  status: 200
```

### Headers

```yaml
expect:
  headers:
    content-type: application/json
    cache-control: no-cache
```

Header validation is case-insensitive and ignores parameters (e.g., `charset`).

### Body

You can validate JSON, XML, or plain text bodies.

#### JSON Body Validation

```yaml
expect:
  body:
    json:
      id: 1
      name: John Doe
```

Nested objects are supported. The validator checks exact equality.

To validate deeply nested fields, you can use **dot notation** (as in the `extract` block). A key containing a dot is interpreted as a path to the value in the JSON response.

Example: If the response contains `{"user": {"profile": {"email": "test@example.com"}}}`, you can validate the email like this:

```yaml
expect:
  body:
    json:
      "user.profile.email": "test@example.com"
```

Dot notation also works with arrays (e.g., `items.0.name`).

#### XML Body Validation

```yaml
expect:
  body:
    xml:
      "/note/to": "User"
      "/note/from": "YATL"
```

The keys are XPath expressions, and values are expected text content of the matched element.

#### Plain Text Body Validation

```yaml
expect:
  body:
    text: "Hello, world!"
```

The validator checks if the expected substring is present in the response text.

## Data Extraction

You can extract values from a response and store them in the test context for use in subsequent steps.

Use the `extract` block:

```yaml
extract:
  user_id: id
  token: access_token
```

The extraction mechanism depends on the response content type. YATL automatically detects the response format (JSON, XML, or text) based on the `Content-Type` header, and also analyzes the content if the header is missing.

### JSON Extraction

For JSON responses, you can specify a path (key) in the JSON object. If the path is `null`, the key name is used as the path. Dot notation is supported for extracting nested fields.

Example: If the response is `{"id": 123, "user": {"email": "test@example.com"}}`, you can extract the email as follows:

```yaml
extract:
  user_email: user.email
```

You can also extract array elements using an index (e.g., `items.0.name`).

### XML Extraction

For XML responses, specify XPath expressions:

```yaml
extract:
  note_to: "/note/to"
```

If XPath is not provided (value `null`), the key is used as a tag name.

### Plain Text Extraction

For plain text, you can use regular expressions:

```yaml
extract:
  match: "\d+"
```

If a pattern is not provided, extraction is not performed (explicit pattern is required).

## Templating with Jinja2

YATL uses Jinja2 templating to dynamically generate values in requests, expectations, and extractions. The context includes:

- Variables extracted from previous steps.
- The `base_url` and test name.
- Any custom variables defined in the test.

### Usage in YAML

Wrap templated strings in double curly braces:

```yaml
request:
  url: /users/{{ user_id }}
  headers:
    Authorization: Bearer {{ token }}
```

### Example

```yaml
steps:
  - name: Login
    request:
      method: POST
      url: /login
      body:
        json:
          username: admin
          password: secret
    extract:
      token: access_token
  - name: Get profile
    request:
      method: GET
      url: /profile
      headers:
        Authorization: Bearer {{ token }}
```

## Parameterization of test data

Parameterization is a way to run the same test with different inputs. Parameterization avoids code duplication, since the same code is executed, but with different input parameters. Parameterization in YATL is implemented through the keyword `parametrize'. 
Let's look at an example without parameterization and with it.

Example without parameterization with code duplication:



```yaml
name: ping
base_url: google.com

steps:
  - name: access_test
    request:
      method: GET
    expect:
      status: 200

  - name: failed_test
    request:
      method: GET
      url: /not_found
    expect:
      status: 404
```

In that case, if we wanted to add new checks to the test (for example, to cause error 403), then we would have to add a new step. The same goes for deleting and editing code in tests. A lot of identical tests complicate the support of test cases. Let's look at how to avoid code duplication using parameterization.:

```yaml
name: Params test
base_url: google.com


steps:
  - name: Ping

    parametrize:

      - path: /
        expected_status: 200

      - path: /not_found
        expected_status: 404

    request:
      method: GET
      url: "{{ path }}"
    expect:
      status: "{{ expected_status }}"
```

Benefits

- Reduced duplication: Define test logic once, run with multiple parameters
- Better maintainability: Changes to test logic apply to all parameter combinations
- Improved readability: Clear separation between test structure and test data
- Scalability: Easy to add new test cases by adding parameter rows



## Running Tests

Tests are run with the `yatl` command from the project root. It automatically discovers all `.yatl.yaml` or `.yatl.yml` files and executes them.

## Examples

### JSON API Test

```yaml
name: JSON API Example
base_url: https://api.example.com

steps:
  - name: Create item
    request:
      method: POST
      url: /items
      body:
        json:
          name: "Widget"
          price: 9.99
    expect:
      status: 201
      body:
        json:
          success: true
    extract:
      item_id: id

  - name: Retrieve item
    request:
      method: GET
      url: /items/{{ item_id }}
    expect:
      status: 200
      body:
        json:
          name: "Widget"
          price: 9.99
```

### XML API Test

```yaml
name: XML Service Test
base_url: http://localhost:8000

steps:
  - name: Get XML
    request:
      method: GET
      url: /xml
    expect:
      status: 200
      headers:
        content-type: application/xml
      body:
        xml:
          "/note/to": "User"
          "/note/from": "YATL"
```

### Plain Text Test

```yaml
name: Text Endpoint
base_url: http://localhost:8000

steps:
  - name: Get greeting
    request:
      method: GET
      url: /text
    expect:
      status: 200
      body:
        text: "Hello"
```


### Common Errors

- **Header mismatch**: Ensure header values are normalized (e.g., `content-type` may include charset).
- **JSON extraction fails**: Verify the path exists in the response.
- **Templating errors**: Check that variables are defined in the context.
